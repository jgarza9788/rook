// Resolves "image://fileicon/<name1>,<name2>,…" two ways:
//
// With a tint ("…?c=rrggbb", appended via Colors.tint() in QML), the GIO
// icon-name candidates map onto rook's own glyph set. The sidebar and
// chrome use monochrome symbols; "&style=content" adds two-tone folders
// and special-folder emblems in file views. All colours derive from the
// supplied theme/selection colour. The URL carries the style and colour,
// so theme switches and selection changes re-render through QML bindings.
//
// Without a tint, the candidates resolve against the icon theme as before.
// That path stays for the icons that are genuinely someone else's brand —
// the applications in the Open With list.
